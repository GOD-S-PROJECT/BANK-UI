##   STEP-BY-STEP TO USE THE BANK APPLICATION

Customer Request: A bank transaction begins when a customer initiates a request for a specific financial service. Whether it's withdrawing cash, depositing funds,  the customer's needs set the transaction in motion.

Transaction Details: With authorization granted, the customer provides the necessary transaction details. This includes specifying the amount to be transacted or furnishing any additional relevant instructions.

Processing: The bank's system processes the transaction, employing various technologies and interfaces. 

Settlement: During the settlement phase, the transaction is finalized and necessary adjustments are made to the involved accounts. 

Confirmation: To provide peace of mind, the bank issues a confirmation to the customer, acknowledging the successful completion of the transaction. This confirmation can be delivered through an on-screen message.
